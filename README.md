# MNE Eagle Eye

[This](https://gjovani.github.io/mne-eagle-eye/) is a simple map of the street surveillance cameras in Montenegro.

Currently, more and more cameras are still being installed around Podgorica but also in other cities as well, so this page will be updated.

If you see new poles being installed or any that are missing from the map, please let me know (on Twitter) or feel free to edit the csv or geojson file and do a pull request.

Photos are also welcome! :)

Thank you!

p.s. custom logos are made by my sister! ❤️
there are more versions/ideas, so we will update them too.
