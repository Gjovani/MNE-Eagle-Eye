# MNE Eagle Eye

<p align="center"><img src="assets/logo_1.svg" width=300></p>

[This](https://giogio.me/mne-eagle-eye/) is a simple map of all the new surveillance cameras in Montenegro.

Currently, more and more cameras are still being installed around Podgorica but also in other cities as well, so this page will be updated.

If you see new poles being installed or any that are missing from the map, please let me know (on Twitter) or feel free to edit the csv or geojson file and do a pull request.

Photos are also welcome! :)

Thank you!
